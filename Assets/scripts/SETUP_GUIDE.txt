# Game Intro Setup Guide

## Scripts Created:
1. **GameSceneManager.cs** - Master controller for game flow
2. **CameraIntro.cs** - Camera cutscene controller
3. **DialogueUI.cs** - Dialogue text display (updated)

## Setup Instructions:

### 1. Scene Setup
- Create a scene called "MainScene" (or name it in GameSceneManager)
- This is where the cutscene and dialogue will play

### 2. GameSceneManager Setup
- Create an empty GameObject in your scene
- Name it "GameSceneManager"
- Add the `GameSceneManager` script to it
- Configure settings:
  - Main Scene Name: Enter your main scene name
  - Load Scene On Start: Check if you want auto-start
  - Scene Load Delay: 0.5s (default)
  - Dialogue Start Delay: 1s (default)

### 3. Camera Setup
- Select your Main Camera
- Add the `CameraIntro` script to it
- Settings:
  - First Rotation Duration: 2s (X-axis: 90° to 0°)
  - Second Rotation Duration: 2s (Y-axis: 0° to 90°)
  - Start Delay: 0.5s
  - Play On Start: UNCHECK (GameSceneManager will control it)

### 4. DialogueUI Setup
- Create a Canvas (if not exists)
- Create a TextMeshPro object for dialogue
- Add/configure your DialogueUI component
- Initially, the dialogue object can be active or inactive (GameSceneManager will handle it)

### 5. Link References in GameSceneManager
- Drag the CameraIntro component to the "Camera Intro" field
- Drag the DialogueUI component to the "Dialogue UI" field

### 6. Build Settings
- Add your MainScene to Build Settings (File > Build Settings)

## Game Flow:
1. Game starts
2. Scene loads (if needed)
3. Camera cutscene plays (rotation animations)
4. Short delay
5. Dialogue UI appears and text starts typing

## Testing:
- Press Play in Unity
- The sequence should run automatically
- Camera rotates, then dialogue appears

## Troubleshooting:
- Check Console for debug messages
- Make sure all references are assigned in Inspector
- Ensure scene name matches exactly
- Verify CameraIntro "Play On Start" is UNCHECKED
