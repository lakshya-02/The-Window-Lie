# Hospital Ward

A short narrative experience about voices, silence, and borrowed hope.

You are terminally ill, lying in a hospital ward.  
A conversation with someone nearby becomes the only thing that makes the room feel alive.

There are no mechanics to master.  
No winning or losing.

Just words, pauses, and the things we imagine to survive a little longer.
